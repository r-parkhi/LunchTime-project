### MoSCoW Prioritization
#### Must have:
- Easy access to menu  
  - Need to know what’s for breakfast/lunch quick  
#### Should have:
 - Average wait time that gives an estimate for how long the lunch line will be till there will no longer be one (particularly for those who do NOT sit in the quad)
#### Could-have:
 - Ratings on the food options on the menu to see what the most popular meals are
   - Can see what foods are good or bad to have an enjoyable meal
 - Sign-up/login option
   - Show favorite menu items, save filters, prevent multiple ratings
#### Won’t-have:
 - Guaranteed food that is most wanted (including fruit/drinks)
   - The app will not have the ability to see what is still left each day and add input, too difficult to implement. 
 - Comments on specific items
   - Too difficult to monitor/filter comments
