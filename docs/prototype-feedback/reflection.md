# Reflection

**Strengths:** entree page clarity, page navigation, dietary restrictions, calendar, wait time

**Issues:** confusion with rating & favorites system, some difficulty finding what was a display and what was part of the prototype, homepage layout

**3 takeaways from observations:**

- Participants tended to try and click on the sides and drinks (after clicking on entrees)

- The most common button first clicked was the chicken caesar salad (in the middle of the screen) 

- Many participants could not decipher between what was clickable and what was display (should be fixed in the real app)

**3 takeaways from survey:**

- Most people said Calendar & Entree page were easy to understand

- Most people mentioned issues that we were already aware of due to Figma limitations such as dietary restrictions being non-functional.

- Some people said the colors were confusing

**Possible improvements:**

- Favorites page

  - List of favorite entrees

  - See when a certain entree will be on the menu soon

  - Unfavorite entrees

- Change homepage layout

  - Option 1

    - Sides & drinks → button to slide-out page

    - Shift entrees to the left

  - Option 2

    - Group then shift sides & drinks to the right

  -

- Entree running out - “Could Have” feature

  - Icon on entrees that tend to run out soon, need to collect data

- Calendar refinements

  - Put a box around today instead of just a green highlight

  - Update dates weekly

- Add a Help page

  - Explain features that may confuse users

  - FAQ section

- Wait time clarity

  - Add “hrs” & “mins”

- Add what dates apply to each day of the week
