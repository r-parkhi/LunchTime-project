 <p>Welcome to LunchTime!, a web app designed to keep CCA students informed and excited about their daily lunch options. We provide students with up-to-date menus, nutritional information, and a personalized experience with ratings, favorites, and dietary restriction filters. 

Created by a dedicated team of developers and designers, LunchTime! was inspired by the need for a simple and convenient way for students to know what's being served in their school cafeterias. We believe that students deserve to have an enjoyable lunch everyday.


Happy lunching,
LunchTime!</p>
